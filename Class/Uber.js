I did a function within function. I know itâ€™s not efficient, but was playing around.  The function of uberRate(customerCity, index), I'm gaining access to uberRate's array index by passing in the same index as customerCity.  It works until one day someone adds more cities and/or more rates, or some cities share same rate.
